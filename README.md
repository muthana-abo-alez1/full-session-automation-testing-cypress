# FullSession Automation Testing with Cypress

## Overview

This project was developed during my intensive Quality Assurance Developer Trainee program at **FullSession** (Sep 2023 – Jul 2024). It focuses on manual and automated testing of a live company website using **Cypress** for automation and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** with **Gherkin** syntax.

## Key Features

- **Manual Testing:** Comprehensive evaluation of real-world software to identify issues and ensure quality.
- **Automation Testing:** Test scripts written in Cypress to automate functional test cases.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Structured and maintainable test architecture separating page locators and test logic.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Use of Gherkin syntax to write clear, understandable test scenarios improving collaboration.
- **Hands-on Experience:** Testing a live company website simulating real-world scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) – End-to-end testing framework
- [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) – BDD syntax for writing test scenarios
- TypeScript
- Page Object Model design pattern
